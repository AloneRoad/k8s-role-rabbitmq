## We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as
## a conscious choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on
## environments with little resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to
## specify resources, uncomment the following lines, adjust them as necessary,
## and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
## If you decide to set the memory limit, make sure to also change the
## rabbitmqMemoryHighWatermark following the formula:
##   rabbitmqMemoryHighWatermark = 0.4 * resources.limits.memory
